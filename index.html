                <h2>End Federal Law Enforcement Violence and Uphold Constitutional Duty</h2>
                <p class="date">Date: 1/24/26</p>
                <div class="letter-content">
                    <p>I am writing out of deep distress and outrage at yet another fatal shooting involving federal immigration agents in Minneapolis. Reports confirm that a man was shot and killed by federal agents early this morning (1/24/26) in south Minneapolis, marking at least the third such deadly encounter in recent weeks. </p>
                    <p>This pattern of violence — following the killing of Renée Good and other armed confrontations — is unacceptable and demands immediate action. Our communities deserve safety, not escalation. Minnesota Governor Tim Walz has condemned this latest incident and called for a halt to the federal operation in the state, emphasizing that these tactics are “sickening” and must end.</p>
                    <p>The power of the federal government does <em>not</em> include operating what amounts to a police force under direct executive control without proper constitutional oversight. The President does not get unilateral authority over domestic law enforcement; that is why the Founders put <strong>checks and balances</strong> in place. Congress was designed to oversee, restrict, and restrain executive action — especially where lives are lost and civil liberties are at stake.</p>
                    <p>I stand with Governor Walz, with Minnesota, and with all citizens who expect their representatives in Congress to uphold the Constitution, protect public safety, and <strong>rein in federal law enforcement operations that are out of control</strong>. Silence and inaction are failures of your oath.</p>
                    <p>I urge you to act — publicly, decisively, and without delay — to:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Condemn this pattern of federal shootings on U.S. soil</li>
                        <li>Demand an immediate halt to federal enforcement operations like this in Minneapolis</li>
                        <li>Pass legislation that restores constitutional limits on executive power and prevents federal immigration agents from operating as an unaccountable domestic police force</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Our communities should be safe. Our government should be lawful. Anything less is unacceptable.</p>

                <h2>Reckless Foreign Policy Is Putting the U.S. Economy at Risk</h2>
                <p class="date">Date: 1/20/26</p>
                <div class="letter-content">
                    <p>I am writing to express serious concern about the economic consequences of the administration's escalating rhetoric and actions toward Denmark, Greenland, and the European Union—and Congress's failure to intervene.</p>
                    <p>Recent moves by European institutions, including Danish pension funds and broader EU actors, to reduce or divest from U.S. Treasuries should alarm every member of Congress. U.S. debt stability depends on international trust. Undermining that trust threatens higher borrowing costs, market instability, and the real risk of a recession or worse.</p>
                    <p>This is not abstract. If major foreign holders continue pulling back from U.S. Treasuries, it directly raises interest rates, weakens the dollar, and hits ordinary Americans through higher prices, lost jobs, and reduced retirement security. Congress cannot pretend this is hypothetical.</p>
                    <p>The rhetoric and suggestions around "taking" Greenland are unacceptable. Greenland is not a bargaining chip. Denmark is an ally. Threatening allies for territorial or political gain damages U.S. credibility and accelerates exactly the kind of financial pullback we are now seeing.</p>
                    <p>Americans do not want this. We do not want economic self-sabotage. We do not want to be pushed toward a depression because Congress refused to rein in reckless foreign policy behavior.</p>
                    <p>I expect Congress to act—publicly and decisively—to reassert its authority, stabilize relationships with allies, and protect the economic well-being of the American people. Silence and inaction here are not neutral. They are dangerous.</p>

                <h2>Failure of Congressional Oversight and Constitutional Duty</h2>
                <p class="date">Date: 1/6/26</p>
                <div class="letter-content">
                    <p>I am writing to express my deep anger and disappointment at Congress's ongoing failure to enforce its constitutional role as a check on executive power.</p>
                    <p><strong>I am not okay</strong> with Congress allowing Donald Trump to exercise effectively unfettered authority. The Constitution does not grant a president unchecked power—it explicitly relies on Congress to restrain abuse. That responsibility is being ignored.</p>
                    <p><strong>I am not okay</strong> with the unlawful use of U.S. military force against Venezuela without proper authorization or accountability. I am not okay with the use of ICE and military powers against lawful U.S. citizens, nor with the erosion of due process that Congress is permitting through its inaction.</p>
                    <p><strong>I am not okay</strong> with reckless rhetoric and threats toward allies, including statements regarding Greenland, that undermine U.S. credibility and global stability.</p>
                    <p><strong>I am not okay</strong> with the rampant spread of disinformation and propaganda that Congress continues to tolerate, normalize, or excuse.</p>
                    <p>If someone is pushing a glass of water off the edge of the table, it still falls off when you do nothing. Silence and inaction are choices—and Congress is making them. If checks and balances are not enforced now, they cease to exist in practice.</p>
                    <p>I expect you to uphold the Constitution, assert Congressional authority, and act—publicly and decisively—to restrain abuses of power. Anything less is a failure of your oath.</p>
